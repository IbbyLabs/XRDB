## [v1.0.4] - 01/04/2026

### Fixed
* hide sticky rail toggle on mobile
  
  Only show the sticky rail control at the xl breakpoint and above where the sticky preview mode can actually apply.
  
  This removes a dead mobile control without changing the saved sticky preference for desktop users.
* restore desktop sticky preview rails
  
  Move sticky positioning onto the live preview rail instead of clipping it inside nested scroll containers.
  
  Keep vertical overflow available for the page and preview accordion so showcase, preview, and guide can follow the viewport again on desktop layouts.
* restore anime ratings and stream badges
  
  Send browser like headers for anime rating requests so public instances keep resolving MAL, AniList, Kitsu, and Jikan responses more reliably.
  
  Include supported network badges in the default quality badge set and add regression coverage for anime provider mapping and default stream badge rendering.

## [v1.0.3] - 01/04/2026

### Fixed
* rebalance workspace layout at desktop widths
  
  Keep the side rail below the primary workspace until very wide screens.
  Move sticky preview behavior to 2xl so the center stage content does not clip.
  Stack AIOMetadata source panels vertically so the right rail stays readable.
* rename Discord release embed branding
  
  Update the Discord release embed author label to XRDB, eXtended Ratings DataBase.
  
  Keep the release notification tests aligned so the old project name does not return in future release posts.

## [v1.0.2] - 31/03/2026

### Fixed
* restore mobile nav and remove repo status copy
  
  Remove the leftover active repository status copy from the public site and README surfaces.
  
  Add a shared mobile aware nav for the home and docs pages so the menu works on small screens.
  
  Show both Live and Latest deployment pills in the shared nav to match the deployment status layout.

## [v1.0.1] - 31/03/2026

### Documentation
* align XRDB repo copy with active status
  
  Remove archived handoff wording from the standalone XRDB repository.
  
  Update the README, shared status notice, and metadata copy so the new repo reads as the active project.

## [v1.0.0] - 31/03/2026

### Added

* publish the first standalone XRDB release
* ship the XRDB configurator, docs, proxy routes, and image generation workflow as the initial public snapshot
* include the deployment files, release automation, and Docker publishing setup used by the active XRDB repo
